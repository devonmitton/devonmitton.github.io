title: I am a Designer

For the past few years I've been calling myself a "User Experience Designer". I was very proud of the label. I felt like I was among the elite group of individuals. It made me feel good.

To my colleagues, I'm sure I seemed smug with an attitude of superiority. Meanwhile, I didn't spend my time picking fonts and colours or working in InDesign, so several people explained to me that I'm not actually a designer.

## Design is more

When we talk about design, we're often talking about something that looks good (the iPhone, the Tesla Model S), and we are correct in saying so. But design is more than that.

The iPhone was designed too look good, but Siri was also designed, and Siri doesn't look like anything. The Tesla Model S was designed to look good, but under all of the beautifully curved metal and glass is a frame that is designed to bend and break during a collision to keep people safe.

I'm not a conventional designer since I don't spend my days obsessing over how something looks. While I do care about the aesthetics and see it as very important to a user's experience, I also care about how it **works**, and how it **feels to use it**, and **how it fails people**, and **how it affects people**, and **how it creates delight** for them. All of these ways to think of design are just as important as how it looks.

## Design is for

I think we need to redefine our understanding of design and realize that first and foremost, design is for something. A object of design exists for a reason. Design is intentional.
