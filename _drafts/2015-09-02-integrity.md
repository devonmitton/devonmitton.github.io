When I hear people speak about "Integrity", they're usually talking about being honest, or doing the things they said they would do, or even saying what they think and feel.

Those are all great things, but I discovered that integrity is much more than that.

Integrity comes from the same two latin root words that give us words like **integer**, or **integrate**:

* **in** - which means *not*
* **tangere** - whith means *to touch*.

Integer means that something remains *untouched*, *untainted*, *uncorrupt*, *not lacking*, *complete*, *whole*.

Likewise, **integer** means a *whole number*; it's a number that doesn't have a decimal. It's complete. **Integrate** means to make separate things *whole*.

On the other hand, I think our word Integrity speaks better to the other ideas: untouched, untainted, uncorrupt, intact.

It's something of character. Something that really isn’t measurable from the outside because it's something that’s deep within a person. Are they a person who is intact, untainted, uncorrupted, not lacking?

I think integrity only really means something for the person claiming to have it. It only really matters for that person if they are not compromising on who they want to be, and what they believe about the world and themselves.
