# About

Hi there! I'm a designer that loves to work with code and make things.

I've been a designer for over 15 years having worked at several kinds of companies doing different kinds of work. Along the way I've learned tons of skills and grown my strengths as a designer.

Currently, I'm the Product Design Manager at [Bold Commerce](https://boldcommerce.com), where we make ecommerce products and solutions for platforms like Shopify, BigCommerce, WooCommerce, CommerceTools and others.
