<h1>About</h1>
<p>Hi there! I'm a designer that loves to work with code and make things.</p>
<p>I've been a designer for over {{ site.time | date: '%Y' | minus: page.career_start }} years and a design manager for over {{ site.time | date: '%Y' | minus: page.manager_start }}. I've worked at several kinds of companies doing different kinds of work. Along the way I've learned tons of skills and grown my strengths as a designer and leader.</p>
<p>Currently, I'm a Product Design Manager at <a href="https://clio.com">Clio</a>, where we make cloud-based legal software.</p>
