        <h2>Speaking</h2>
        <p>I've always been drawn to teaching. The only problem was I'm terrified of public speaking. In 2014 I decided to get over my fear and start giving talks on Design and User Experience.</p>
        <p>The following is a video of a talk I gave when I worked at <a href="http://thinkshiftinc.com" target="_blank">Think Shift</a> for a &ldquo;Lunch &amp; Learn&rdquo; all about how design is far more than just how it looks.</p>
        <p class="whimsy text-center">Enjoy!</p>
