        <h2>Speaking</h2>
        <p>I've always been drawn to teaching. The only problem: I was terrified of public speaking.</p>
        <p>In 2014 while working at <a href="http://thinkshiftinc.com" target="_blank">Think Shift</a>, I decided to get over my fear and start giving talks on Design and User Experience. Since then I have spoken at several &ldquo;Lunch and Learns&rdquo;, both to staff and clients, as well as spoken a few times at <a href="http://www.rrc.mb.ca/" target="_blank">Red River College</a> to the Graphic Design classes.</p>
        <p class="whimsy text-center">Enjoy!</p>

        <h3>Design for Use</h3>
        <p>The following is a video of a Lunch and Learn hosted at Think Shift all about how design is far more than just how it looks.</p>
