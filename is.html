        <h1>I&#39;m a User Experience Designer</h1>
        <h2>What on earth is that?</h2>
        <p>A <strong>User&#39;s Experience</strong> is every aspect of a person&#39;s interaction with an organization, it&#39;s products or services which impacts how they think and feel and what they expect.</p>
        <p>A <strong>User Experience Designer</strong> is responsible for creating an environment for positive and delightful experiences to happen.</p>
        <p class="whimsy right">In other words, I like making things easy to understand and easy to use.</p>

        <h2>What I believe about the work that I do</h2>
        <p>Not my job, but I believe my life&#39;s work is all about helping people <strong>experience better</strong>.</p>
        <p>There&#39;s so much in our world that we use because it&#39;s there and it does the job, but not necessarily well. I want people to expect more from design. To expect that it doesn&#39;t just solve a problem, but it creates delight.</p>
        <p>I hope to try and make the world a better place because the things we use are better. The companies we buy from and work for are better. Our governments are better. Because I&#39;ve helped change people&#39;s perceptions and they expect that <strong>everything can be better</strong>.</p>
        <p class="whimsy left">It&#39;s pretty lofty, I know. However I&#39;m still going to try.</p>

        <h1>I&#39;m a Husband and Father</h1>
        <p>I&#39;m pretty much the luckiest guy in the world. I might be exaggerating, but that&#39;s how I feel. Much of who I am is because of my family.</p>
        <p>When I&#39;m not working, I&#39;m playing <strong>Minecraft</strong> with my son, painting and making a mess with my daughter, or chasing after them both with my wife.</p>
        <p>My family is the best thing I&#39;ve made and I love to brag about them. My instagram feed is full of pictures of just my kids and I&#39;m not going to apologize for that.</p>
        <p class="whimsy right">Sorry about that.</p>
