  <p>I'm a designer that loves to code and make things. I see design as not simply making things look nice (although that is a part of it), but as making things make sense. I'm simply trying to leave this world a little bit nicer than how I found it.</p>
  <p>I'm currently leading a fantastic team of product designers at <a href="https://clio.com" class="link link--clio">Clio</a> as a product design manager.</p>
