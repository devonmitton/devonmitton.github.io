  Hi there! Glad you dropped in to take a look :)

  My guess is that you're looking for some technical details. Before we get into
  that I want to be transparent: I'm looking for a job and I've applied at a few
  places before I saw that there were some available positions at Basecamp, and
  Basecamp is not the only organization for which I've made a site like this.

  It will be trivial for you to review the technical details of my site to find
  out what I'm about to explain, but I wanted to be in the open regardless :)

  The Platform:
  =============
  This site is powered by Jekyll on Github Pages. If you want to peek at the
  source code for everything, you can see the public repo here:

  https://github.com/devonmitton/devonmitton.github.io


  The Styles:
  ===========
  I'm not using Bootstrap or anything for the styles. Instead I'm using my own
  homebrewed SASS framework which I call "bedrock", because Minecraft, and well,
  Flintstones.

  https://github.com/devonmitton/bedrock

  It's pretty minimal, and I've refined it over the past three years of using it
  or some variation of it. While "Bedrock" is young, it's evolved from other projects
  of a similar nature.

  The evolution began with CSS Resets (Eric Meyers), to Blueprint.css, to a SASS
  framework I built for a company I was working for to help with rapid prototypes
  and to become a pattern library for the sites we worked on (inspired by Bootstrap,
  Blueprint and HTML5BP), to the current version I have now.

  Thanks for taking a look around :)

        <p>I believe that everything in this world can always be better and I&#8217;ve made it my life&#8217;s work to leave the world a bit better than how I found it. So I became a designer.</p>
        <p class="ta-center whimsy">Sounds lofty, I know. But I'm still going to try.</p>
        <p><a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-team-the-years-29f984d2f2eb">I hear that you folks are hiring</a>! I&#8217;ve been a big fan of Basecamp (37Signals) for a long time. I&#8217;ve often thought about what it would be like to work for such a great company, in fact I spent a lot of time inspired by you guys to make changes to where I work with some of your ideas.</p>
        <p>I wanted to give you a good sense of what I value, and what I&#8217;m like to work with in hopes to see if we&#8217;re a good fit. So please consider this page my &ldquo;cover letter&rdquo;.</p>

        <p>I began my career as a web (ui) designer, and I quickly learned HTML/CSS and JavaScript. My first job was working with Flash and creating &ldquo;interactive experiences&rdquo; and I discovered that the product is better when &ldquo;how it looks&rdquo; meshes with &ldquo;how it works&rdquo;. I learned that I was able to make better designs when I understood the code behind the scenes. I found the product seemed to mesh better; it wasn&#8217;t clunky or disjointed. It created a &ldquo;how it feels&rdquo;.</p>
        <p>Since then I&#8217;ve approached design with a holistic view that starts by thinking of the outcomes, and working backwards from there by asking questions like &ldquo;someone uses this thing, then they go on with their day. How do we want them thinking and feeling after they&#8217;ve used it, and how to we go about creating that for them?&rdquo;. Because people often think about Design as &ldquo;how it looks&rdquo;, I&#8217;ve been calling myself a &ldquo;user experience designer&rdquo; to describe my approach.</p>
        <p>I define a user&#8217;s experience as every point of impression or interaction a person has with an organization, their products or services which impacts how they think and feel about that organization. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the role of a single &ldquo;user experience designer&rdquo;. However, I think that&rsquo;s everyone&rsquo;s job to create delightful interactions with those users and customers. I think everyone is designing something from their eloquence, modularity, and simplicity in code to all the considerations into how people think about and interact with buttons and interfaces, down to well-crafted elements of copy.</p>
