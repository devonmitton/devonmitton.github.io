        <p>We typically think professionalism means someone who dresses a certain way, or acts a certain way, or speaks a certain way. We usually have a prototypical “professional” in mind when we hear that term.</p>

<p>The problem with that is that concept actually goes against what professionalism originally meant.</p>

<!-- More -->

<p>You have to peel back the layers of meaning that we’ve applied to that word to understand where it came from, but I’m going to start from the bottom and build up new layers to try and make a new understanding of the word for us. Here are the definitions of the base components of <em>professionalism</em>:</p>

<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Word</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><th>Pro</th><td>For, Before, Outward</td></tr>
    <tr><th>Fateri</th><td>Declaration</td></tr>
    <tr><th>-ion</th><td>A suffix for changing nouns into verbs: Doing something</td></tr>
    <tr><th>-al</th><td>A suffix for changing verbs into adjectives: Being something </td></tr>
    <tr><th>-ism</th><td>A suffix for changing adjectives into action-nouns: A belief or idea</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>All of this leads us to the following definition:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Professionalism</strong> (<em>n</em>) - The idea of being a person that does what they have declared publicly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a nutshell, a professional is a person that does what they (publicly) said they were going to do. That’s it.</p>

<p>Nothing in there about how to dress, or how to talk, and the only thing that approaches the idea of how to act is simply doing what you said you were going to do.</p>

<p>This means that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>People don’t <em>dress</em> professionally unless they’re dressing in accordance to what they said they were going to do.</li>
  <li>People don’t <em>behave</em> professionally unless they’re behaving in accordance to what they said they were going to do.</li>
  <li>People don’t <em>speak</em> professionally unless they’re speaking in accordance to what they said they were going to do.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sorry business people, “dressing professionally” is actually just dressing <strong>business-like</strong>.</p>

<p>Being a professional means that you make a public declaration of who you are and what you will do, and you do and be those things.</p>
