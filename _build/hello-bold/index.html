      <h1>My name is Devon Mitton</h1>
      <p>I believe that everything can be a bit better and my life’s work is to try and leave the world a bit better than how I found it. Sounds lofty, I know, but I’m still going to try.</p>
      <p>So I became a Designer.<br><small class="mute">(A User Experience Designer, to be specific.)</small></p>
      <p>I hear that you folks are hiring! I wanted to introduce myself and give you a sense of what I’m all about so we can see if we’re a good fit for eachother.</p>

      <p>I love what I do, and I sometimes do it as a hobby. I will always meet deadlines and sometimes I will work extra to ensure that I will. But work is not the center of my life, it’s how I make a living.</p>
      <p>Sometimes kids are sick, or they need picking up or dropping off somewhere. I need the flexibility to serve my family, and I will be flexible to ensure the work is done.</p>

    <div class="container half">
      <p>I started out as a web designer. Then I learned back-end programming and discovered that the product is better when “how it looks” meshes with “how it works”. It creates a “how it feels”, that isn’t clunky or disjointed.</p>
      <p>So I’ve started to take on a wholistic view of design that starts by thinking of the outcomes, and working backwards from there.</p>
      <p>A user’s experience is every point of interaction a person has with an organization, their products or services, which impacts how they think and feel about that organization. A user experience designer is responsible for creating an environment where the best and most delightful interactions can happen.</p>
      <p>I love to noodle out ideas with a pen and paper, work in Sketch to create layouts and design patterns, build them in HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and even dive into the server-side code and work with data structures. But I’m most at home designing UI and building them with HTML/CSS/JavaScript.</p>

    <div class="container half">
      <h1 class="h3 ta-center">I challenge everything.</h1>
      <p>I’m not trying to be a jerk, I’m just trying to understand why. I think debates are good because it forces the best idea to win, and as long as the debates are not about ego. I’ve been told by many people that I’m stubborn.</p>
      <p>I do have very strong opinions, but they are loosely held. This is why I challenge everything. I’m always looking for better ways to do things, so I’m always testing, researching, and tinkering. When a better idea comes along and it survives the testing and researching, I will adopt it instantly. But I’m not satisfied to do things just because thats how they’ve been done.</p>

          <p>Devon is an extremely talented designer. More than that he truly shines at design ethos and identifying team dynamics and culture. Limiting Devon to user experience does not do him justice. He envisions a larger world of people not limited to users and customers roles but an ecosystem of positive experiences for all.</p>

          <p>I'm in awe with Dev's commitment to his family and his craft. He is able to take complex ideas, break them down and explain and teach solutions. What is amazing about Devon is not that he can solve problems, but his drive to explain and teach. Devon challenges assumptions and holds everyone accountable as he holds himself.</p>
