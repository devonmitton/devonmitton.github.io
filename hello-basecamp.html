  Hi there! Glad you dropped in to take a look :)

  My guess is that you're looking for some technical details. Before we get into
  that I want to be transparent: I'm looking for a job and I've applied at a few
  places before I saw that there were some available positions at Basecamp, and
  Basecamp is not the only organization for which I've made a site like this.

  It will be trivial for you to review the technical details of my site to find
  out what I'm about to explain, but I wanted to be in the open regardless :)

  The Platform:
  =============
  This site is powered by Jekyll on Github Pages. If you want to peek at the
  source code for everything, you can see the public repo here:

  https://github.com/devonmitton/devonmitton.github.io


  The Styles:
  ===========
  I'm not using Bootstrap or anything for the styles. Instead I'm using my own
  homebrewed SASS framework which I call "bedrock", because Minecraft, and well,
  Flintstones.

  https://github.com/devonmitton/bedrock

  It's pretty minimal, and I've refined it over the past three years of using it
  or some variation of it. While "Bedrock" is young, it's evolved from other projects
  of a similar nature.

  The evolution began with CSS Resets (Eric Meyers), to Blueprint.css, to a SASS
  framework I built for a company I was working for to help with rapid prototypes
  and to become a pattern library for the sites we worked on (inspired by Bootstrap,
  Blueprint and HTML5BP), to the current version I have now.

  Thanks for taking a look around :)

        <p>I believe that everything in this world can always be better and I&#8217;ve made it my life&#8217;s work to leave the world a bit better than how I found it. So I became a designer.</p>
        <p class="ta-center whimsy">Sounds lofty, I know. But I'm still going to try.</p>
        <p><a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-team-the-years-29f984d2f2eb">I see that you folks are hiring</a>! I&#8217;ve been a big fan of Basecamp (37Signals) for a long time. I&#8217;ve often thought about what it would be like to work for such a great company. In fact, I spent a lot of time making changes to where I work inspired by some of your ideas.</p>
        <p>Please consider this page my cover letter. I wanted to give you a good sense of what I value and what it&#8217;s like to work with me so we could see if we&#8217;re a good fit for eachother.</p>

        <p>I began my career as a web designer, and I quickly learned <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading StyleSheets">CSS</abbr> and JavaScript. I discovered that the product was better when &ldquo;how it looks&rdquo; meshed with &ldquo;how it works&rdquo;; It made the product feel <em>seamless</em> and it didn't feel <em>clunky</em>.</p>
        <p class="whimsy ta-center">I learned we can design how a product <em>feels</em>.</p>
        <p>Since then I&#8217;ve approached design with a holistic view that starts by thinking of the outcomes, and working backwards from there by asking questions like &ldquo;How do we want people thinking and feeling after they&#8217;ve used it, and how to we go about creating that for them?&rdquo;.</p>
        <p>Because people often think about design as &ldquo;how it looks&rdquo;, I describe myself as a user experience designer to better communicate the holistic concept. Although, UX has become a bit of a buzzword lately.</p>
        <p>So, I define a user&#8217;s experience as every point of impression or interaction that a person has with an organization, their products or services which impacts how they think and feel about that organization. I don&#8217;t think that definition describes the role of a single &ldquo;user experience designer&rdquo;. I think that ultimately it&#8217;s everyone&#8217;s job within an organization to create delightful interactions for those users and customers.</p>

        <h2>I challenge everything</h2>
        <p>I’m not trying to be a jerk, I’m just trying to understand the “why”. I think debates are good as long as they’re not about ego because it forces the best idea to win, and I’m always on the look-out to equip myself with the best ideas.</p>
        <p>I’ve been told by many people that I’m stubborn. I do have very strong opinions, but they are loosely held. This is why I challenge everything. I’m always looking for better ways to do things, so I’m always testing, researching, and tinkering. When a better idea comes along and it survives the testing and researching, I will adopt it instantly. But I’m not satisfied to do things just because that’s how they’ve been done. I need to understand “why”.</p>
