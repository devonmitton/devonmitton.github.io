  Hi there! Glad you dropped in to take a look :)

  My guess is that you're looking for some technical details.


  The Platform:
  =============
  It's powered by Jekyll on Github Pages. If you want to peek at the source code
  for everything, you can see the public repo here:

  https://github.com/devonmitton/devonmitton.github.io

  You will notice that you are not the only company that I've built a page like
  this for, so I'll be upfront about the whole thing: I'm looking for a job, and
  I'm applying at multiple locations.


  The Styles:
  ===========
  I'm not using Bootstrap or anything for the styles. Instead I'm using my own
  homebrewed SASS framework which I call "bedrock".

  https://github.com/devonmitton/bedrock

  It's pretty minimal, and I've refined it over the past three years of using it.
  It originally started as a rapid prototype SASS framework (like bootstrap) when
  I was working at Think Shift: https://github.com/wearethinkshift/source

  Thanks for taking a look around :)
