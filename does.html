        <h2>Canadian Tire Innovations</h2>
        <h3>Senior UX Designer, October 2014 &mdash; Present</h3>
        <p>Life in Canada depends on Canadian Tire, which means that Canadian Tire needs to really understand Canadians and what they need, even before they know they need it.</p>
        <p>The Canadian Tire Innovations group is the group that is looking forward to the horizon to find the next thing to change the landscape of retail, and what we expect from life in Canada.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, I can&#39;t tell you what I do here, or I&#39;d have to kill you.</p>
        <p class="whimsy right">I&#39;m joking about the whole &ldquo;killing&rdquo; thing... But I still can't talk about my projects.</p>

        <h2>Think Shift Advertising</h2>
        <h3>Senior UX Designer, March 2011 &mdash; October 2014</h3>
        <p>It was really good to be at Think Shift. The company specializes in brand, culture and leadership, and the proof is in how great those things are at Think Shift.</p>
        <p>I started as an Interaction Designer then changed into the role of User Experience Designer where I worked closely with clients like <a href="http://cabelas.ca/" target="_blank">Cabela's Canada</a>, <a href="http://cargillag.ca" target="_blank">Cargill Ag Canada</a> and <a href="http://ecampusmanitoba.com" target="_blank">eCampus Manitoba</a>.</p>

            <p>I helped Cargill take six websites and combine them into &ldquo;one website to rule them all&rdquo; and make it easier for people find what they're looking for.</p>
