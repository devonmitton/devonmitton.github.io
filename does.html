        <h2>Canadian Tire Corporation, Innovations</h2>
        <h3>Senior UX Designer, October 2014 &mdash; Present</h3>
        <p>Life in Canada depends on Canadian Tire, which means that Canadian Tire needs to really understand Canadians and what they need, even before they know they need it. The Canadian Tire Innovations group is the group that is looking forward to the horizon to find the next thing to change the landscape of retail, and what we expect from life in Canada.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, I can&#39;t tell you what I do here, or I&#39;d have to kill you.</p>
        <p class="whimsy right">I&#39;m joking about the whole &ldquo;killing&rdquo; thing... But I still can't talk about my projects.</p>

        <h2>Think Shift Advertising</h2>
        <h3>Senior UX Designer, March 2011 &mdash; October 2014</h3>
        <p>It was really good to be at Think Shift. The company specializes in Brand, Culture and Leadership, and the proof is in how strong all three of them are at Think Shift.</p>
        <p>I started there as an Interaction Designer, then changed into the role of User Experience Designer where I worked closely with clients like <a href="http://cabelas.ca/" target="_blank">Cabela's Canada</a>, <a href="http://cargillag.ca" target="_blank">Cargill Ag</a> and <a href="http://ecampusmanitoba.com" target="_blank">eCampus Manitoba</a>.</p>

            <p>I designed and built a new primary navigation system that made use of a &ldquo;Mega Menu&rdquo; design pattern. As a result we saw:</p>

            <div class="stat">
                <span class="number">59.1</span>
                <span class="delta">% increase</span>
                <span class="details">in sales from same day previous year</span>
            </div>
            
            <p>I joined the Cabela&#39;s Team at Think Shift to help optimize the user's experience. One of the first things I did was perform usability tests with audience members to identify quick and easy opportunities for improvement.</p>
            <p>The results of the tests showed that the website was a bit sluggish and people were frustrated with the primary navigation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I designed and prototyped the new mega menu system to help people find the right path, and get them to product quicker.</li>
                <li>I rewrote JavaScript to load the bulk of it after the page was loaded and optimized images and CSS. We reduced load times from eight seconds to one.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Other design work I began for Cabela&#39;s included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Redesigning the product details pages to make it easier to choose product options (not yet deployed).</li>
                <li>Redesigning the product listings pages for better promotions, and preparation for a responsive overhaul (not yet deployed).</li>
                <li>Redesigning the checkout process to reduce dropoff and increase conversions by simplifying the process (not yet deployed).</li>
            </ul>

                <h1>CargillAg</h1>    
            </header>

            <p>CargillAg Canada needed to redesign their website, and amalgamate six separate websites into one single site to rule them all.</p>
            <p>I designed the information design to join these sites together. As a result we saw:</p>

            <div class="stat">
                <span class="number">60</span>
                <span class="delta">% decrease</span>
                <span class="details">in visitor bounces</span>
            </div>
            
            <p>My role on the project involved:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Creating content models for copywriter templates, CMS structure, and content relationships</li>
                <li>Designing wireframes for website templates</li>
                <li>Designing user flows for website navigation structure</li>
                <li>Performing usability testing</li>
                <li>Creating recommendations for performance and usability optimizations</li>
            </ul>
