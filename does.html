        <h2>Canadian Tire Corporation, Innovations</h2>
        <h3>Senior UX Designer, October 2014 &mdash; Present</h3>
        <p>Life in Canada depends on Canadian Tire, which means that Canadian Tire needs to really understand Canadians and what they need, even before they know they need it. The Canadian Tire Innovations group is the group that is looking forward to the horizon to find the next thing to change the landscape of retail, and what we expect from life in Canada.</p>
